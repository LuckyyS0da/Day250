📅 Day 1 of 260 — 5th August 2025
🚀 Goal: Get internship-ready in InfoSec with 260-day consistency

🔐 Today's Focus: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

📘 What I Learned:
- ✅ Basics of XSS and its impact on web apps
- ✅ Difference between Reflected, Stored, and DOM-based XSS
- ✅ Understood how input is injected into the HTML context unsanitized

🧪 Labs Completed (PortSwigger):
1. 🧪 Reflected XSS into HTML context with nothing encoded — ✅ Solved
2. 🧪 Stored XSS into HTML context with nothing encoded — ✅ Solved
3. 🧪 DOM XSS in document.write sink using source location.search — ✅ Solved

💡 Key Takeaway:
"User input should never be trusted. Always sanitize and encode before rendering into the DOM."

🔧 Tools Used:
- PortSwigger Web Security Academy
- Microsoft Edge (worked after retry)
- GitHub (repo setup complete!)

🔥 Consistency > Intensity
